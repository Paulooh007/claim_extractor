Now, these people we eventually caught why not try them and let us whether these people will either  be jailed or freed. I want to believe that some of our leaders in this country they owe our, our citizens, they owe Nigerians an apology not just coming to win election by all cost. Thank you sir. Thank you.  Thank you for joining the discuss. Let me take you in today, see if you checked my pages on social media, Twitter, you will find a story about the Banning of Kuje prison in Abuja. And I said here, if a report by the Vanguard newspaper is anything to go by, Soldiers deployed around kuje prison who had mastered the terrain were replaced 24 hours before the terrorist invaded the prison. Why was it 24 hours after troop re-deployment that the terrorists, are there internal collaborators undermining the system?,  remember this, Mallam Tuko Mamu, Media consultant to Islamic cleric Sheikh Hamad gummy says before the attack. He shared intelligence Report with the authorities concerned, but they failed to act. You know, Buhari was lamenting recently. When Buhari laments the people suffer, when Buhari visit Kuje prison Nigeria suffers, ,when Tinubu goes to France, the people grow hunger, hungry people everywhere.  Hungry people in the south, in the north, south east, hungry people, north West hungry, people. Let nobody deceive you with ethnic politics this time.  When they are striking these, they don't remember ethnic politics, when they are lounging in Turkey and France. They Don't remember Ethnic politics. When it comes to voting, they remember that you are Yoruba. Igbo and Fulani, don't allow that this time,  Vote your conscience. This time. If you miss it, this time, the people will suffer again and this suffering will lead to something. If you don't know.  You know, I am asking,. Wike, there, Wike here.  What does Wike want?  Why is everyone asking Wike is hand in marriage?  Let's look at this and perhaps make some definitions from them.  Atiku did not pick Wike as his running mate, Atiku says, Okowa personifies not only the seriousness the current moment represents for Nigeria, but also the future that young Nigerians yearn for and deserve.  So Wike does not fit into that definition. Is that the point Atiku makes?  A point Atiku makes is that he knows that sometimes a candidate is chosen who generates the balls and adds, huge excitement to the campaign.  But in Nigeria of the moment,  Atiku Abubakar says. We Face huge challenges that levels with little room for drama.  Was it that he finds Wike too dramatic for the serious task of nation building?.  Now, this is Wike in church.  Wike in church exhibits the Wike  drama.  In church.  Nyesom wike calls on Thunder to act, what kind of Wike is this?  Yes. Some people say we youth congress, we enjoy national congress congress, threaten Government, you're wasting your time.  I'm not, I don’t know why people don’t even know who they are dealing with, me, threaten me, only 48 hours.  instead of you to come to Government,  What is problem? What happened?  You mean to threaten Government with ultimatum.  Thunder Fire you and ultimatum.  He did not call on God for help. He called on Thunder inside the church.  Wike from his utterances sees every disappointment as betrayal. Listen to him, keenly.  Everybody betrays Wike.  Atiku who has betrayed him now.  When Wike lost the ticket to Atiku, he returned to Rivers State and shouted, betrayal, betrayal. I have been betrayed. I refuse to be a second-class citizen.  Who are the first class citizen Wike referred to in that speech? perhaps he was talking about Atiku and Tambuwal Alliance therefore he was talking about the Fulani that he refused to play Second fiddle. I agree with him. Nobody should be a second-class citizen. Edmund Obilo cannot be. That's not the issue now.   When Wike lost that ticket, he said fellow Southern Governors, betrayed him, you know, take note of a man that everybody betrays, there must be something with him. When everybody betrays a particular man, there is something. When Seyi Makinde betray Wike, I will answer that question.  I quote Wike “shame to those who will sell their own.  I have never seen anything like that. No wonder we cannot move on with development Southern Governors sold their own”. So it's Wike saying those from the north are not part of us, you see the rhetoric display their own, those from the south. Their own, those from the north, their own. We must stop that politics. If we want to build one Nigeria. See, there's something I like about the PDP politics that threw up Atiku Abubakar.  Perhaps it was able to break this ethnic definition. Let's play the politics you win. I win.  Remember the radio man does not stand for Ethnic politics Muslim, Muslim ticket, does not bother me.
